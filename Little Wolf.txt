Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

You've made your worst mistake here, might be your last one too
You'll have run out of bones to break when you and I are through
I'll teach you all the lessons your daddy never could
This cruel world doesn't give out presents just for being good, so

Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain me?
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike
Wanna be a man? Then
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight

Or die, little wolf, die
Don't you know it's fight or
Flight, little wolf, flight?
All because you had to
Try, little wolf, try
Run away before you
Die, little wolf, die, little wolf, die

Need some help?
What's going on here?
Is your plan to stand around?
'Cause I suggest you fight back
I don't know how
Uppercut him, now

Whoa, how did I do that?
Is time now moving slow?
No, I just made your thoughts quick
Woah, that is so sick!
Alright now, let's try this again

I've no respect for bullies, those who impose their will
I've seen plenty enough to truly understand this kind of filth
Let's teach this dog a lesson in front of all his kind
One young wolf has a larger heart than all these men combined

Fight, little wolf, fight
Show them that you've got some
Bite, little wolf, bite
Take advantage now and
Strike, little wolf, strike
Don't go down without a
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf
Get up and fight

Fight, little wolf, fight
Wanna entertain us? (Oh, oh-oh)
Bite, little wolf, bite
Let's see how you take this
Strike, little wolf, strike (strike!)
Wanna be a man? Then (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Fight, little wolf, fight, little wolf, fight (fight!)

Oh, maybe I pushed you a bit too hard
Ow

Go back and cry in your corner
Make sure your mother hears
If she won't choose a man to adorn her, we'll bring blood and tears

Tell me, Athena, why you came to my aid
