These waves and tides
Have grown in strength and size
Is it nature or divine
Or a blessing in disguise?
Our home's in sight
This storm's our final fight
There's no time to die
Comrades?

Sir!

Brace for a storm
Storm
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm
Storm
With home so close, we must keep pushing forward
Full speed ahead

Head towards the island but avoid the crashing waves
Tread where the tide is flat and then you will be saved

Captain, we will capsize with these waves, our fleet will fail

Have them follow my ship, I'll ensure that we prevail

Storm
Storm

We're taking too much damage to survive

We'll beat this storm
Storm

At this rate, we won't make it out alive

Captain, look!

An island in the sky

Eurylochus, grab the harpoons
As many as you can find

What do you have in mind?

We're gonna shoot for the sky

What?

Storm, storm

Everyone grab a harpoon and aim it high

Storm, storm

We're shooting for the island in the sky
In the sky

Storm, storm
