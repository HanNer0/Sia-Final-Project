Someone arrived today
They said they're taking you away
That you're not mine to save
And soon I won't get to see your face
So I came by to say
You're unlike anyone I have ever known
'Cause you're all I've ever known

And if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you

But I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you

Calypso

Let me speak
I spent my whole life here
Was cast away when I was young
Alone for a hundred years
I had no friends but the sky and sun
So when you washed ashore
I thought for sure that you were my dream come true
I thought I knew

So if I pushed you
Or if I came on too strong
Or if I ambushed you
For that, I'll say I was wrong
And if you hate me
Then I am sorry my love's too much for you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

But I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you
I'm not sorry for loving you

I'm not sorry
I'm angry and tired and restless and sad
I'm stuck in the moments I swore that we had
I wish you would chase me
Or try to embrace me
For once, I wish you would lie and say

I love you

You do?

But not in the way that you want me to

I hate that I fell in love with you
Hate that I fell in love with you
Why did I fall in love with you?
Why did I fall in love with you?
What do I do with this love for you?
What do I do with this love for you?
How am I supposed to get over you?
How am I supposed to get over you?
Why in the world won't you love me too?
