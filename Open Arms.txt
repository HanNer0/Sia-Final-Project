You can relax, my friend
Huh?
I can tell you're getting nervous
So do yourself a service
And try to relax, my friend
I'm fine, Polites
Think of all that we have been through
We'll survive what we get into

I know that you're tired of the war and bloodshed
Tell me, is this how we're supposed to live?
Look at how you grip your sword, enough said
Why should we take when we could give?
You could show a person that you trust them
When you stop and lower your guard
Here we have a chance for some adjustment
Give it a try, it's not that hard
I'm telling you

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world, here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

Stay back (stay back)
My friend, greet the world with open arms
We're only here for food (food)
Six hundred friends are waiting for us to show our faces (food)
Stay back, I'm warning you (food)
If we don't get back safely
My men will turn this place into blazes (here you go)
See?

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world, here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

My friend, I wish that I could say that I agree
But look at the way this fruit is glowing and filled with glowing seeds
It took me a while to notice just what kind of fruit they eat
It's a lotus, it controls your mind and never lets you free
That's what we'd get with open arms

Lotus eaters
I'd like to show my friend that kindness is brave
Could you tell me where there's other food to eat?
(The cave)
A cave!
You're saying there's a cave where we could feast?
And where do we sail to find this food-filled cave?
(East, that way)
Thank you!
(Welcome)

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
I see in your face, there is so much guilt inside your heart
So why not replace it and light up the world, here's how to start
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

Greet the world with open arms
You can relax, my friend
