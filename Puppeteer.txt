Captain, I have something that I must confess
Something that I must get off my chest
Until it is said, I cannot rest
(Captain?) Eurylochus, go make sure this island is secure
(But captain) there's only so much left we can endure
Whatever you need to say can wait some more
Of that, I'm sure
(Okay)

Eurylochus, back so soon?
Where's the rest of your crew?
And by the gods, what happened to you?

We came across a palace
Inside we heard a voice
It seemed to show no malice
To greet it was our choice
But nothing could prepare us for the power that awaited inside
(What did this palace hide?)

Sir, since we left home, we've faced a variety of foes from a wide range of places
Gods, monsters, you know the roster, hostile creatures that we could resist
But this was a hell of a twist, 'cause we are weak to a power like this
(What was it?) A woman
(What?) She had us in just two words

"Come inside" (damn)
Welcome to the best part of your lives
Go ahead and rest wherever you like
I've got you, don't worry, Circe's got you now
(Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in)

Take a seat
Let me bring you all something to eat
I bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet
I've got you, don't worry, Circe's got you now
(By the time they ate, it was far too late)

For inside the meal (think of your past)
She had cast a spell (and your mistakes)
They began to squeal (they'll be the last)
And grow snouts and tails (mistakes you'll make)
She changed them
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

They transformed (this is the price)
And it wasn't quick (we pay to live)
She turned our men (the world does not)
From men to pigs (tend to forgive)
She changed them
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

no, we don't
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned
Every single cost is so much more than what we've earned
Think about the men we have left before there's none
Let's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run

Of course, I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run
But I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done
There's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save
I can only hope you'd do the same

I can hear her still (no one will find)
And her voice deceives (their way between)
What if she can't be killed? (My nymphs and I)
Will you choose to leave? (Their loving queen)
(I don't know)
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah

She's a clever witch (this is the price)
And she's hard to slay (we pay to love)
It's a game of wits (we draw the line)
But you don't have to play (watch from above)
I have to try
I've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power
No, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer
No, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah
