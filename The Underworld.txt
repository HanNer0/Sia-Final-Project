Friends, Circe's instructions were clear
No matter what we hear

Full speed ahead
Until we find the prophet

My comrades, this land confuses your mind
So no matter who we find

Full speed ahead, until we find the prophet

Good

All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
And here in the Underworld, the past seems close behind
This land confuses your mind

When does a man become a monster?
Five hundred fifty-eight men who died under your command
Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!
Why would you let the cyclops live
When ruthlessness is mercy?

All I hear are screams, every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream, only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it seems
But in the Underworld, the past seems close behind
I keep thinking of the infant from that night
I keep thinking of the infant from that night

This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms

Polites

Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start:
Greet the world with open arms
Greet the world with open arms

Polites

Waiting

That voice, it can't be

Waiting

Mom?

Waiting
Odysseus, when you come home I'll be waiting
Even if you're the last thing I see, I'll be waiting

I'm right here, mom
Can't you see? I'm (waiting)
Waiting

I took too long

I'll always love you

And ventured too far

I'll stay in your heart

While you were
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Bye mom

All I hear are screams
(All I hear are screams)
Every time I dare to close my eyes
I no longer dream
(I no longer dream)
Only nightmares of those who've died
Nothing's what it seems
(Nothing's what it seems)
But in the Underworld, your past is always close behind
Your past is always close behind
Down in the Underworld
