Lady of the palace, sorry that I ask this
But I hope that I've been misinformed
I sent out some scouts to take a look around through here
And they wound up at your doors
Through the years, we seldom get a warm welcome
So I must ask just to be sure
Did you do something to them?

Who, me?
All I did was reveal their true forms

You turned them into pigs

Huh

I don't know who you are, nor why you're here
But let me make this one thing clear
I've got people to protect
Nymphs I can't neglect
So I'm not taking chances, dear

If you make one wrong move, then you're done for
Anything I don't approve, then you're done for
I could put a spell on you, and you're done for
Boy, you better run, or soon you will be done for

I don't mean to tip your scale but
You will fail at placing any spells on me
I just ate a flower, one that claims your power
So you better cower now and flee

You must be a liar
Mortals can't acquire
Moly without dire consequence

Then I must be a god like you
'Cause I got this root from the ground with my bare hands

Hermes gave it to you, didn't he?

Okay, fine, yes, but regardless

You and I are now evenly matched
Our fates are intertwined, they're attached
I've got people to protect
Friends I can't neglect
So now, there is no turning back

You've made your one wrong move, now you're done for
I will be the one to prove that you're done for
Not even a spell saves you, 'cause you're done for
Oh, you better run, or soon you will be done for

You've lost

My nymphs are like my daughters
I protect them at all costs
The last time we let strangers live
We faced a heavy loss
You've given me no reason to bestow you with my trust
But everyone's true colors are revealed in acts of lust

I'm not sure I follow
