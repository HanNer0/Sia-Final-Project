Let's cut the charade, you are no wife of mine
You've been tryin' to take my life this whole time
I know underwater, there are packs of you hiding
Yeah, I know exactly what you are, a siren
My real wife knows I'm not scared of the water
And my real wife knows I don't have a daughter
But while you were so focused on turning my men into snacks
You didn't notice that your friends got snatched
  
What?
  
We are a different beast now, we are the ones who feast now
No more of us deceased, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters, we are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer, we won't take more suffering from you
  
We've been away from home for about 12 years or so
First, we slayed in our own war, and now, we're here with more foes
While on the run from Poseidon, we found a ship with no crew
I realized nearby, there were sirens, singing sailors to their dooms
  
We filled our ears with beeswax, that's how we resist your song
You pretended to be my wife, so I just played along
I read your lips and phrases, scanning for information
Sirens know about every route and horizon
Now I know how to get back to my island
  
We are a different beast now, we are the ones who feast now
No more of us deceased, 'cause we won't take more suffering from you
We are the man-made monsters, we are the ones who conquer
You are a threat no longer, we won't take more suffering from you
  
Spare us
Oh, spare us, please
  
Why?
So you can kill the next group of sailors in this part of the sea?
Nah, you wouldn't have spared me
I made a mistake like this, it almost cost my life
I can't take more risks of not seeing my wife
Cut off their tails! We're ending this now
Throw their bodies back in the water
Let them drown (no)
  
He is a different beast now, he is the one who feasts now
No more of us deceased, 'cause he won't take more suffering from you
He is the man-made monster, he is the one who conquers
You are a threat no longer, he won't take more suffering from you
  
Kill them all
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh
Kill them all
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh
Kill them all
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh
Kill 'em all
Oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh
