Father, God King
Rarely do I ask for favors
Now, I'm knocking on your door
With hopes to save a friendship with one who's a prisoner far from home
Odysseus

Divine intervention, is that what you seek?
To untie apprehensions that were placed on that Greek?
You are playing with thunder for a man full of shame
But if he's worth the risk of going under, why not make it a game?
Convince each of them that he ought to be released, and I'll release him

Who's them?

Apollo, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Ares, Hera, or me
What do you say?

Great

Very well

Eh

Alright

Groovy

Bring it

Apollo!

You all know I'm a fan of catchy songs
So with so many sirens gone, I think Ody's in the wrong

They were trying to do him worse
All he did was reimburse them
Now they'll tread with caution first
To live another day and sing another verse

If that's true, release him

Hephaestus!

Trust is not given, it's forged
Why should I give him my support?
He sacrificed his own cohort

Did you forget they failed to listen?
He was betrayed and then imprisoned
But if you make the right decision
He can still build a future with those who miss him

Fine, release him

Aphrodite

Your little high and mighty Odysseus
Claims to love his mother
But let her die of a broken heart

He was busy fighting

More like busy spiting the cyclops
Let him feel the pain that his mother felt and rot

Wait, please reconsider this

Really Athena? These old tricks?

Ares!

Ares, Ares

What kind of sick coward
Holds back his power
While his friends get devoured?
He didn't even fight Scylla
Didn't even try to kill her
Hides inside a wooden horse to get the job done
Never handles things upfront
Pathetic and weak like his son

Hold your tongue now
His son's my friend
And tell your lover that a broken heart can mend
You want more bloodshed?
Then set him free
To get back to his homestead, he'll make everybody bleed

Ugh, release him

Hey baby

Hera!

So many heroes
So many tales
Give me one good reason why yours should prevail

He's got the mind of a genius

Try harder

He's pretty skilled with words

You can do better than that

He's kind of funny?

Eh

Never once has he cheated on his wife

Release him

I've played your game and won
Release him

You dare to defy me?
To make me feel shame?
No one beats me, no one wins my game!

Thunder, bring her through the wringer
Show her I'm the judgement call
The one who makes her kingdom fall!

Is she dead?

Let him go, please
Let him go
