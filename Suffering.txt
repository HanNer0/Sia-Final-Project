Penelope
Penelope

Don't you miss me?

More than you know

Then jump in the water and kiss me

Penelope, I've told you this before
You know I'm afraid of the water

I'll make sure that you are safe and sound
Come play with me and our daughter and let's watch our love leave the ground

Oh, I would
But I'd be suffering trying to float the whole time

I would take the suffering from you

Ooh, as good as that sounds, right here I'm just fine

I can take the suffering from you

You know that I prefer my feet on the ground

I will take the suffering from you

Fine, but only if you answer a question or two

Of course

Okay, so let's say I was on the run or hiding-
From I don't know Poseidon-
And let's say he blocked the way home with giant waves and giant storms

Oh, no

How am I to evade him?
How am I to get home?
Which route should I take?
Where am I supposed to go?

He will chase you high and low
So find a place he'd never go
The one way you'll get home
Is sailing where he's scared to roam, oh
It's through the lair of Scylla

No

This is your only way home
The lair of Scylla

But Scylla has a cost

Well, you asked and now you know
Now, jump in the water

Penelope, why?
You know I'm too shy and terrified

I would take the suffering from you

Ooh, for you, I would die, but can't you let me stay dry?

I can take the suffering from you

You should come onto the ship
We'll jump at the same time

I will take the suffering from you

Ah, the things I do for you
