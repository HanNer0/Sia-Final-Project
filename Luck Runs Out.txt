Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do
You've heard the legends of the island in the sky
This proves they're true
We're in the home of the wind god
We don't know for sure
How many floating islands have you seen before?
This is the home of the wind god
And what's your plan?
I'm gonna climb to the top and ask 'em for a hand

You could be caught off guard and lose your life
Or piss off this god and infuse us with strife
Don't forget how dangerous the gods are
Have faith, friend, we've come this far

Yes, but how much longer 'til your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

I still believe in goodness
I still believe that we could be kind
Lead from the heart, and see what starts
And what will we do when it tears us apart?
Where is this coming from, my friend?
I just don't wanna see another life end
You're like the brother I could never do without
And suddenly, you doubt that I could figure this out?

Captain, how much longer 'til your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, woah
How much longer 'til the snake breaks free?
How much longer 'til your great days cease?
How much longer 'til your strength takes leave?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

Thank you for the concern, but brother, I can assure you
Our journey is almost done
I understand that we're tired, I understand that we're fazed
But don't forget how much we've already faced
I took 600 men to war and not one of them died there
In case you needed a reminder
If you'd like to speak more, let me pull you aside then
I need to talk to you in private

I can't have you planting seeds of doubt
I can't have you disagreeing each route
I need you to always be devout and comply with this
Or we'll all die in this
Okay?
Okay
Thank you
