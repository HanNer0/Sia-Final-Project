You must be who Hermes mentioned
A monster here to block my way
I'd like to hurry up and end this
So if you don't have much to say

Then, oh, bring it on
I'm not dying here, I'm still fighting here
I'm holding on
'Til I see it through, 'til I've beaten you

I already know your tactics
When you swallow you attack with whirlpools that attract prey
But I see a disadvantage, 'cause I don't even have to kill you
I just have to avoid you
See, if you don't spit it out soon, all that water will destroy you

Oh, bring it on
'Til you're out of breath, 'til there's nothing left
I'm holding on
'Til I'm in the clear, 'til I'm out of here, oh

There, I see it
The island I've been searching for
Home, I've reached it
My wife and son are past these shores
Holding on
I am almost there
My love, don't be scared
Hold on
I am on my way
I'll be there today
Penelope

What?

No
