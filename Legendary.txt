It's just me, myself, and I
Stuck in my bedroom, livin' in this world you left behind
Dreamin' of all these monsters that I'll never get to fight
But boy, I wish I could, so I could bring the world some light

'Cause I'm stuck with your stories, but no clue who you are
And no idea if you're dead or just too far
Somebody tell me, come and give me a sign
If I fight those monsters, is it you I'll find?
If so, then

Give me sirens and a cyclops
Give me giants and a hydra
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
The Minotaur, even Cerberus
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be l-l-l-l-legendary

There are strangers in our halls
Tryin' to win the heart of my mom, but she is standing tall
108 old faces of men who call me small
They keep takin' space and it's not much longer we can stall

'Cause they're getting impatient, dangerous too
And I would fight them if I was half as strong as you
Somebody help me, come and give me the strength
Can I do whatever it takes to keep my mom safe?
If so, then

Give me sirens and a cyclops
Give me giants and a hydra
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary
I'll fight the harpies and chimeras
The Minotaur, even Cerberus
I know life and fate are scary
But I wanna be legendary

Where is he?
Where is the man who'll have you to wife? Oh-woah
Where is he?
Where is the man with whom you'll spend your life?
'Cause it's been twenty years

Twenty years

And we still have no king

And I'll overcome these obstacles and scrutiny andâ€”
