Tell me you did not know that would happen
Say you didn't know how that would end
Look me in the eyes and tell me, Captain
That you did not just sacrifice six men?
Use your wits to try and say I'm crazy and mad
That this is all some trick the gods have sent
Tell me you did not miss home so painfully bad
That you gave up the lives of six of our friends?

When we fought the cyclops, you were quick to hatch a plan
And when we fought with Circe, it was you who left behind no man
But when we fought this monster, we didn't take a stand
We just ran
Say something

I can't

Then you have forced my hand

Eurylochus

Lower your weapon

No can do
You miss your wife so bad, you trade the lives of your own crew

Don't make me fight you, brother, you know you'd have done the same

If you want all the power, you must carry all the blame

Eurylochus, Eurylochus, Eurylochus
Odysseus, Odysseus, Odysseus
There is no price he won't pay

I am not letting you get in my way
My brothers, why?

How are we supposed to trust you now?
Now your time has come, your luck's run out
Now, the time has come to shut you down
You relied on wit and then we died on it
Whoa-oh-oh

Agh, my head
Where are we?

Some island, the first one we found
It's bursting with cows just roaming around
Begging us to eat, so much meat
And hunger is so heavy
This statue
The God of the Sun
Don't know where it's from
But here's where we found all these cows to hunt
Right in front
And hunger is so heavy (hunger is so heavy)

Please don't tell me you're about to do what I think you'll do

Ody, we're never gonna get to make it home
You know it's true

You don't know that's true
This is the home of the Sun God

I'm starving my friend

But if you kill his cattle, who knows what he'll send?
This is the home of the Sun God

I'm tired, my friend

But we're so close to home, this can't be where it ends

How much longer must I suffer now?

Please don't do this

How much longer must I push through doubt?

I need to get home

How much longer must I go about

Eurylochus

My life like this, when people die like this?

Whoa

How much longer must we suffer now?

Reconsider

How much longer must we push through doubt?

We can get home

How much longer must we go about

Eurylochus

Our lives like this when people die like this?
I'm just a man (whoa)

Eurylochus, no!
You've doomed us
You've doomed us all, Eurylochus!

Captain?

We need to get away from this island now!
Grab an oar with all the strength your arms allow
These cows were immortal, they were the Sun God's friends
And now that we've pissed them off, who do you think he'll send?

Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

Faster!

Full speed ahead

Faster!

Full speed ahead
