I'm supposed to choose a suitor to wear the crown
I said I would choose as soon as I weave this shroud
They don't know that every night
I unthread all the work I've done

'Cause I'd rather lie
Than allow them to think they've won
Though I never thought that I'd resort to this
Just know I'll be here

But I don't know how much longer I'll last since we saw that storm
And though it was so close to our kingdom, it was far from the norm, unless
Oh, could it be some kinda sign
That my world is all about to change?
Is it finally time for the challenge I arranged?
Though I never thought that it would come to this
Just know I'll be here buying you time

Time is fleeting, it's running out
Time to be the man of the house (oh, buying you time)
Time is fleeting, it's running out
Time to be the man of the house

Whoever can string my husband's old bow
And shoot through 12 axes cleanly
Will be the new king, sit down at the throne
And rule with me as his queen

Let the arrow fly
Once you know that your aim is true
'Cause I'd rather die
Than grow old without the best of you

Though I never thought that these would be the lengths we go for love
I would not have it any other way
And though I never thought that it would end like this
Just know I'll be here

Waiting, waiting
waiting, waiting
(Penelope) waiting, waiting
Oh
