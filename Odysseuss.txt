For twenty years, I've suffered every punishment and pain
From the wrath of gods and monsters to the screams of comrades slain
I come back and find my palace desecrated, sacked like Troy
Worst of all, I hear you dare to touch my wife and hurt my boy

I have had enough

Odysseus, Odysseus
Odysseus, Ody-

In the heat of battle, at the edge of the unknown
Somewhere in the shadows lurks an agile, deadly foe
We have the advantage, we've the numbers and the might
No
You don't understand it, this man plans for every fight

Odysseus, Odysseus
Odysseus, Odysseus

Where is he? Where is he?
Keep your head down, he's aimin' for the torches
Our weapons, they're missing
He's using the darkness to hide his approaches

We're empty handed, up against an archer
Our only chance is to strike him in the darkness
We know these halls, the odds can be tilted
You don't think I know my own palace? I built it

Odysseus, Odysseus
Odysseus, Odysseus

Old king, our leader is dead
You've destroyed the serpent's head
Now the rest of us are no longer a threat
Old king, forgive us instead
So that no more blood is shed
Let's have open arms instead

No

Odysseus, Odysseus
Odysseus, Odysseus

Damn, he's more cunning than I assumed
While we were busy plotting
He hid our weapons inside this room

I find it hard to believe that the sharpest of kings
Left his armory unlocked

So what?
Now that we have armed ourselves
Let's make the bastard rot

Behind you!

Throw down those weapons
And I ensure you'll be spared

After seeing what the king will do to us
We wouldn't dare

I don't wanna hurt you
But trust me, I've come prepared

Ha! Your very presence has doomed the king, young prince
We don't fight fair

Stop

Brothers, we got company and he's made a grave mistake
Left the weapons room unlocked, and now they're ours to take
Brothers, come and arm yourselves, there's a chance for us to win
We can still defeat the king if we all attack the prince

Where is he? Where is he?
Capture him, he's our greatest chance
Get off me, get off me
Fight 'til the prince can barely stand
Hold him down, hold him down
Make the king obey our command
Hold him down, hold him down
'Cause if he won't, I'll break the kid's hands

Got him

Me-mer

Mercy? Mercy?

My mercy has long since drowned
It died to bring me home
And as long as you're around
My family's fate is left unknown
You plotted to kill my son
You planned to rape my wife
All of you are going to die

Odysseus

You've filled my heart with hate
All of you, who have done me wrong
This will be your fate

Odysseus
