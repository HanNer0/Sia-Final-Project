The lair of Scylla
This is our only way home

Deep down
You're quiet today
Deep down
Not much to say
Deep down

You hide a reason for shame
I've got a secret I can no longer keep
Deep down
You know that we are the same
I opened the wind bag while you were asleep

Leaving them feeling betrayed
Breaking the bonds that you've made
I'm so sorry
There is no price we won't pay
Forgive me
We both know what it takes to survive

Full speed ahead, full speed, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

Deep down
We only care for ourselves
Eurylochus, light up six torches
Deep down, we're lonely demons from hell

Captain, something approaches

Hello

Row for your lives

Drown in your sorrow and fears
Choke on your blood and your tears
Bleed 'til you've run out of years
We must do what it takes to survive
Give up your honor and faith
Live up your life as a wraith
Die in the blood where you bathe
We must do what it takes to survive

We are the same, you and I, I
