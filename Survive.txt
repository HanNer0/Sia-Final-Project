My brothers!
The rest of our fleet
They wait at the beach
cnd if we're defeated they're good as dead
Straight ahead!
That is who we're fighting

No backup
No chance for support
So draw out your swords
Our foe must be thwarted right here and now
Show me how great is your will to survive

Six hundred lives at stake!
It's just one life to take!
cnd when we kill him then our journey's over!
No dying on me now!
Defeat is not allowed!
We must live through this day so
Fight fight fight!

Surround him!

Attack from behind!
Keep distance in mind
cnd stay in his blind spot
cnd strike his heels

Show him that we're deadly!

Exhaust him!

Don't let him get close!
He's strong but he's slow!
He can't land a blow if we're out of reach!
Find a breach!
Stand up and fight for your lives!

(Six hundred lives at stake!
It's just one life to take!
cnd when we kill him then our journey's over!)

Push forward!

(No dying on us now!
Defeat is not allowed!
We must live through this day so fight fight fight!)

Captain

Enough

He's got a club!
He's got a clu-

What are our orders?
Captain?
Capta-

You've hurt me enough

Six hundred lives I'll take
Six hundred lives I'll break

And when I kill you then my pain is over
You're dying here and now
Escape is not allowed

You won't live through this day now
Die!
Diii-iii-ii-ieee
