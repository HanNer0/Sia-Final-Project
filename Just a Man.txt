I look into your eyes and I think back to the son of mine
You're as old as he was when I left for war
Will these actions haunt my days? Every man I've slain?
Is the price I pay endless pain?
Close your eyes and spare yourself the view
How could I hurt you?

I'm just a man who's trying to go home
Even after all the years away from what I've known
I'm just a man who's fighting for his life
Deep down, I would trade the world to see my son and wife
I'm just a man

But when does the comet become a meteor?
When does a candle become a blaze?
When does a man become a monster?
When does a ripple become a tidal wave?
When does the reason become the blame?
When does a man become a monster?

Forgive me
(When does a man become a monster?) Forgive me
(When does a man become a monster?) Forgive me

I'm just a man
