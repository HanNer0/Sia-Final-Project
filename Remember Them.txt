Captain

We must move quickly
We don't have much time
He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine
Mark my words now
This is not the end

But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?

Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain

I need all our hands on his club
This is how we're getting out of here
Use your swords to sharpen the stub
And turn it to a giant spear!
(Let's kill him)
His body is blocking the path
If we kill him we'll be stuck inside
 
Captain, where do we attack him?
 
We gotta stab him in the eye
 
Yes, sir
 
Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain
 
Now
 
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 
Scatter
 
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 
Who hurts you?
 
There are more of them?
 
Who hurts you?
 
Hide
 
Who hurts you?
 
Captain we should run
 
Wait
 
Who hurts you?
 
Captain please
 
Wait
 
It was Nobody Nobody
 
If nobody hurts you be silent
 
Don't go

Let's grab the sheep and away we go
 
Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
He's still a threat until he's dead
Finish it
 
No
 
No?
 
What good would killing do
When mercy is a skill
More of this world could learn to use
My friend is dead
Our foe is blind
The blood we shed
It never dries
Is this what it means to be a Warrior of the Mind?
 
Don't

Hey, cyclops
When we met I led with peace
While you fed your inner beast
But my comrades will not die in vain
Remember them
The next time that you dare choose not to spare
Remember them
Remember us
Remember me

I'm the reigning king of Ithaca
I am neither man nor mythical
I am your darkest moment
I am the infamous
Odysseus
