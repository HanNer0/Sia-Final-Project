There you are, coward

I've been waiting for this moment
For the perfect time to strike
When your home's so close
And you've reached your coast
That's when our paths collide
I've got a reputation
I've got a name to uphold
So I can't go letting you walk or else the world forgets I'm cold

Now get in the water
Get in the water
Or I'll raise the tide so high, all of Ithaca will die
Get in the water

Wait

Get in the water

Stop this, please

I'll make tidal waves so profound
Both your wife and your son will drown

No

Get in the water
Get in the water
Don't mistake my threats for bluff
You have lived more than enough
Get in the water
Get in the water
I'll take your son and gouge his eyes
That is, unless you choose to die
Get in the water

Aren't you tired, Poseidon?
It's been ten years, how long will this go?
We're both hurting from losses
So why not leave this here and just go home?

I can't

Maybe you could learn to forgive

No
Ruthlessness is
Mercy upon
Ourselves
Die

You can relax my friend
I can tell you're getting nervous
Look at all we've lost and all we've learned
I'll stay in your heart
Oh, whoa, Odysseus
Waiting, waiting, waiting, ah
