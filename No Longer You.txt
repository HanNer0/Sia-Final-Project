I am the prophet with the answers you seek
Time, I've unlocked it
I see past and future running free
There is a world where I help you get home
But that's not a world I know

What?

I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayal
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you

This can't be
We've suffered and sailed through the toughest of hells
Now you tell us our effort's for nothing?

I see your palace covered in red
Faces of men who had long believed you're dead
I see your wife with a man who is haunting
A man with a trail of bodies (who?)

I see a song of past romance
I see the sacrifice of man
I see portrayals of betrayal
And a brother's final stand
I see you on the brink of death
I see you draw your final breath
I see a man who gets to make it home alive
But it's no longer you
