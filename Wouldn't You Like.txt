I must say what a brilliant speech you gave
Who goes there?
Just a friend who could help you save your men
A foe like Circe is not to be messed with
You want to beat her?
You'll need the blessing of a certain god
Divine intervention
Someone who's not afraid to send a message

Hermes?

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

She can turn you into an animal that'll end up on her plate
She can all but make you fall in love like you're on your hundredth date
She can conjure up a monster that'll grind you to the bones
She has all the ways to haunt you, when you take her on alone

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

Oh-oh, here in the root of this flower
There lies such a power to take her on
You must consume and digest it
Then you'll manifest a being of your creation
All you need's imagination
Though it's only for a moment
'Til you've beaten your opponent
And I call this root, "Holy moly"

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

Wouldn't you like a taste of the power?
Wouldn't you like to use more than words?
Deep in the night, the fight lasts for hours
You can be hurt or you can beat her
Wouldn't you like to have some of the magic?
Wouldn't you like your outcome preferred?
Deep in the night, the fight can be tragic
I'll help you conquer her

Hermes
Thank you
Don't thank me, friend
You very well may die
Good luck
