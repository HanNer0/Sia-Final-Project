Old friend
It's been ten years since I last saw you

Remember me!
I am the infamous Odysseus!
Oh, woah, woah

Let's see where you've been

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

Ruthlessness is mercy upon oursel-

One wrong move and you're done for
Anything I-

Song of past romance, I see the

We won't take more suffering from you

Drown in your sorrow and fears

Captain?

I have to see her

But we'll die

I know

Odysseus, where did you go?

Morning, sleepyhead
You've been resting for a while
I swore that you were dead
When you washed up on my isle
Did you know you talk in your sleep?
Tell me, though, who's Penelope?

She's my wife

Anyways, I've got all you could want here
All you could need here
Just you and me, my dear, my love for life
Soon, into bed we'll climb and spend our time

I'm not your man

I'm what you want here
I'm what you need here
Just you and me, my love in paradise
Now 'til the end of time
From here on out, you're mine, all mine

Hell no, I could kill you where you stand
I'm no pet, I'm a married man

Oh handsome, you may try
But last I checked, goddesses can't die

Goddess?

You're adorable
Bow down now to the immortal Calypso, here to entertain
But fear not, I bring no pain
'Cause we've got
All we could want here
All we could need here
Under my spell, we're stuck in paradise
No one can come nor go, my island stays unknown

No, no
I don't belong here
There's something wrong here
I won't be drawn to love in paradise
Not 'til the end of time, there is no way

You're mine, all mine

Seven years, she's kept you trapped, out of your control
Time can take a heavy toll

Odysseus?

All I hear are screams

Ody, get away from the ledge

You don't know what I've gone through
You don't know what I've sacrificed
Every comrade I long knew
Every friend, I saw them die
And all I hear are screams

It will be fine, dear
Come back inside, dear
Love of my life, come back to paradise
Let me close my eyes
I know your life's been hard
I'll stay inside your heart

All I hear are screams

I love you, my dear
I love our time here
Life would be so much worse
Just let me close my eyes
If you had died
Please stay from away from harm
Stay in my open arms

All I hear are
This life is amazing when you greet it with open arms
How much longer 'til your luck runs out?
Waiting, waiting, waiting
Whatever we face, we'll be fine if we're leading from the heart
How much longer 'til the show goes south?

Oh

No matter the place, we can light up the world
Here's how to start
How much longer 'til we all fall down?

Oh

Waiting, waiting, waiting

Greet the world with open arms, greet the world with open arms

Athena!

He needs my help
