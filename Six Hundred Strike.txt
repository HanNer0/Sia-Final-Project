Six hundred men (six hundred)
Six hundred men (six hundred)
Six hundred men (six hundred)
Six hundred men (six hundred)

I don't think you seem to get it
I can't afford to die
'Cause I will get back to my son
And I will get back to my wife

For every comrade, every one of my friends
Almost all of whom were slaughtered by your hand
Six hundred strike

Six hundred men (six hundred)
Six hundred men (six hundred)
Six hundred men (six hundred)
Six hundred, six hundred men

You idiot, can't you see?
You sealed your fate just to beat me
You released my storm when you opened that bag
Blocked your one way home
Now you'll never get back

You're going to call off that storm
Or what? You can't kill me
Exactly
Wait, wait, ah!

How does it feel to be helpless?
How does it feel to know pain?
I watched my friends die in horror
Crying as they were all slain

I heard their final moments
Calling their captain in vain
Look what you turned me into
Look what we've become

Enough
All of the pain that I've been through (stop!)
Haven't I suffered enough? Stop!
You didn't stop when I begged you

Told me to close my heart
(You) you said the world was dark (monster)
Didn't you say that ruthlessness is mercy upon our-

Alright, please
After everything you've done
How will you sleep at night?

Next to my wife
