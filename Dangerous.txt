Six hundred men
Six hundred deaths under my command
'Cause I had one goal in mind
No fleet, no band
Only this raft that I made by hand
How will I reach my homeland?

All you have to do is not open this bag

Hermes?

Hello, old friend

So you're the one who talked to Calypso
Why are you here?

You're being given a final option
Consider this your one last chance
To make it back home and abandon caution
Wash it away like the blood your hands have known
I know, if you dance with fate
Then I know, I know, you'll enhance your state

If your plan's so great, then why'd you wait to say it?

Wеll, it's a little bit dangerous, my friend
You need a mindsеt change for this
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
You wanna get home? Put it all on the line
And put your whole brain in it
Remember every trick in your domain for this
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
You wanna get home? Put it all on the line
Be dangerous

Alright, I'm in, what do I do?

First stop, uncharted waters
When lost, look towards the sky
Follow the north star, no matter how far
You think you're goin', you keep on rowin'
When strangers lurk around the isle (Ah-ah)
When danger greets you with a smile (Ah-ah)
Fight your way through, do what you must do
But no matter what, keep moving
It's gonna be dangerous, my friend
You need a mindset change for this
You cannot get away with playing safe for this
You wanna get home? Put it all on the line
And put your whole brain in it
Remember every trick in your domain for this
You gotta treat it like it is the main event
You wanna get home? Put it all on the line
Be dangerous

And lastly, the wind bag
We went through so much to get this
Keep this bag closed if you wanna get home, sir
You won't get another time to try
The ragin' storm inside won't let you get closer
It was meant to stop you by design
'Cause no mortal can pass Poseidon's storm
Open this bag and you'll never make it home
You'll never make it home

Don't you know that danger is my friend?
My whole life I've trained for this
I cannot tell you how much I have paid for this
I have to get home, put it all on the line
I'm gonna use ruthlessness
Every trick, every skill put to use for this
I plan to put an end to all the foolishness
I have to get home, put it all on the line
I'll be dangerous

Hermes
Thank you

Don't thank me, friend
I'm not the one who fought for you
Ha-ha, good luck
