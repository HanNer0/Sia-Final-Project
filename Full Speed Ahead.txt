Six hundred men
Six hundred men under my command
With only one goal in mind
Make it back alive to our homeland
Six hundred men, six hundred miles of open sea
But the problem's not the distance
It's what lies in between

And Ithaca's waiting, Ithaca's waiting
My kingdom is waiting (the kingdom is waiting)
Penelope's waiting for me
So full speed ahead, full speed ahead

Captain, Eurylochus
Six hundred men, six hundred men
Six hundred men with big mouths to feed
And we've run out of supplies to eat
Curse the war, our food store's depleted
Six hundred men (six hundred men)
Six hundred reasons to take what we can
So captain, what's the plan?
Captain, what's the plan?

Watch where the birds fly (watch where the birds fly)
They will lead us to land (they will lead us to land)
There we'll hunt for food, my second in command
Now full speed ahead, full speed ahead

We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go

Captain

Polites!

Look! There in the distance, I see an island
I see a light that faintly glows
Maybe they're people lighting a fire
Maybe they'll share some food, who knows?

Something feels off here
I see fire but there's no smoke

I say we strike first
We don't have time to waste
So let's raid the place and

No
Polites gear up, you and I'll go ahead

You and I'll go ahead

We should try to find a way no one ends up dead

We don't know what's ahead

Give me 'til sunrise, and if we don't return
Then six hundred men can make this whole place burn
Now full speed ahead
Full speed ahead
Full speed ahead

We're up, we're off, and away we go
We're up, we're off, and away we go
Full speed ahead (we're up, we're off, and away we go)
We're up, we're off, and a
Full speed ahead
