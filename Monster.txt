How has everything been turned against us?
How did suffering become so endless?
How am I to reunite with my estranged?
Do I need to change?

I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost
I'm the only one whose line I haven't crossed
What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea
Is me?

What if I'm the monster?
What if I'm in the wrong?
What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along?
What if I'm the one who killed you
Every time I caved to guilt?
What if I've been far too kind to foes
But a monster to ourselves?
What if I'm the monster?

Is the cyclops struck with guilt when he kills?
Is he up in the middle of the night?
Or does he end my men to avenge his friend
And then sleep knowing he has done him right?
When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs
Is she goin' insane?
Or did she learn to be colder when she got older
And now she saves them the pain?

Monster

Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves

Monster

And deep down I know this well
I lost my best friend, I lost my mentor, my mom
Five hundred men gone, this can't go on
I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus
So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches
I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us
And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall
In an instant, so we all don't die

Then I'll become the monster
I will deal the blow
And I'll become the monster
Like none they've ever known
So what if I'm the monster
Lurking deep below?
I must become the monster
And then we'll make it home

[ODYSSEUS, CREW]
(Monster) Penelope
(Monster) Telemachus
(Monster) Oh, ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves
(Monster) I'll become the monster
