Father?

Son

All my life, I'd've died to meet you
Thought about your name so much, it hurts
For 20 years, I've dreamt of how I'd greet you
Oh, and now you're here, I can't find the words

All my life, I'd have died to know you
Days and nights I wish that I could show you
For 20 years, I never could outgrow you
Oh, and now you're here

I can't help but wonder what your world must be
If we're like each other, if I have your strength in me
All this time I've wondered if you'd embrace me as your own
20 years, I've wandered, for so long I've felt alone

Oh, my son, look how much you've grown
Oh, my boy, sweetest joy I've known
20 years ago I held you in my arms
How time has flown, oh

Used to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you
Used to say I'd capture wind and sky for you
Held you in my arms, prepared to die for you
Oh, how time has flown

I can only wonder what your world has been
Things you've had to suffer, and the strength you hold within
All I've ever wanted was to reunite with my own
20 years, we've wandered, but today you're not alone
My son, I'm finally home

Home, home
Father, how I've longed to see you
Home, home
Telemachus, I'm home (home)

Go, tell your mother I'm home
I'll be there in a moment, of course

Show yourself
I know you're watching me, show yourself
You were never one for hellos

I can't help but wonder what this world could be
If we all held each other with a bit more empathy
I can't help but feel like I led you astray
What if there's a world where we don't have to live this way?

If that world exists, it's far away from here
It's one I'll have to miss, for it's far beyond my years
You might live forever, so you can make it be
But I've got one endeavor, there's a girl I have to see

Very well
Father? She's waiting for you
