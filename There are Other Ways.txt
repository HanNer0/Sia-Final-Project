There are other ways of persuasion
There are other modes of control
There are other means of deceit
There are other roads to the soul
There are other options of passion
You have so much left to learn
Want to save your men from the fire?
Show me that you're willing to burn, whoa

Oh, well, who's to say, with all the mistakes I've made (don't be afraid)
That they will be the last (think of your past)
Mistakes I ever make? (Don't break when)
There is so much power, so much power
But there's no puppet here

This is the price we pay for love (I'm just a man)
There is the line never enough (I'm just a man)
So much power, so much power (forgive me)
But there's no puppet here (I can't)

Back at home, my wife awaits for me
She's my everything, my Penelope
And she's all my power, all my power
But it's been 12 long years
Oh, 12 long years since I have seen my wife
And now the God of Tides is out to end my life
So I beg you, Circe, grant us mercy
And let us puppets leave

Ah, Poseidon, eh?

There might be a way to evade him
There might be a way to get home
Though this other way's very dangerous
It might be your one final hope
I know of a brilliant prophet
Problem is this prophet is dead
I can't get you home, but I'll get you to the Underworld instead
I'll release your men, and I'll get you to the Underworld instead

Wait, you're helping us?

There are many ways of persuasion
There are many modes of control
Maybe showing one act of kindness
Leads to kinder souls down the road
I remember actions of passion
I have been in love once before
Maybe one day, the world wont need a puppeteer no more
Or maybe one day, the world wont need a puppeteer more
